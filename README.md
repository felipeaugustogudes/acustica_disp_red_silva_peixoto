**Highlights:** In this directory, we have added the codes of the Generalized Finite Difference Schemes with different types of stencil shapes, the number of points in the stencil, dispersion reduction properties, and other information. All the implementations use the Devito package in Python language.

**Important Informations:** These codes are part of the Project Software Technologies for Modeling and Inversion (STMI) at RCGI in the  University of Sao Paulo.
